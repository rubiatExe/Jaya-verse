## 🚀 Core Features

This application combines real-time data synchronization, generative AI, and a gamified interface to create a uniquely personal and interactive experience.

### Connection & Community
*   **Friend Map:** An interactive world map that visualizes the locations of friends and family, showing their local time and personal messages to make them feel closer, no matter the distance.
*   **Reasons We Love You Jar:** A collaborative "jar" where friends can submit reasons they love Jaya. An AI-powered feature then randomly selects and displays a reason, delivering a surprise moment of joy.
*   **"Open When..." Letters:** A digital take on the classic concept. Friends can submit private notes for specific moods (e.g., "Open when you're feeling sad"), providing comfort and support exactly when it's needed.
*   **Live Activity Feed:** A public feed on the landing page that shows recent messages and reasons left by friends, creating a sense of a living, breathing community.

### Wellness & Self-Care
*   **Life RPG (Role-Playing Game):** A gamified status widget where Jaya can set her current activity (e.g., Reading, Creating, Traveling). Her status is updated in real-time for all visitors, turning daily life into a fun, shared experience.
*   **Self-Talk Sesh:** An AI coaching tool powered by Genkit. Users can input a self-doubting thought, and the AI reframes it into a kind, positive, and empowering perspective.
*   **Daily Trackers:** Simple, beautiful trackers for daily water intake and menstrual cycles, complete with visual rewards (like a blooming rose) for meeting goals.
*   **Dream Board:** A visual, collage-style board for personal goals and aspirations, allowing users to upload images and titles to visualize their dreams.
